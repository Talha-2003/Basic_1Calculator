Simple calculator (core Java OOP)
A minimal, console-based calculator that demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming in Java: classes, objects, constructors (overloading), encapsulation, and instance methods. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with either interactive input or pre-supplied values.

Features
Two constructors: Zero-parameter (reads input via Scanner) and parameterized (accepts numbers directly).

Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, divide.

Interactive choice: Decide at runtime whether to enter numbers manually.

Encapsulation: Private fields a and b with instance methods operating on object state.

Clear flow: Single operation per request, like a real calculator.

Project structure
Package: com

Classes:

SimpleCalculator: Holds state (a, b) and exposes operations.

LearningCalculator: Contains main; handles user interaction and operation selection.
